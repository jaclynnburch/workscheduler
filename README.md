# Work Day Scheduler

A simple calendar app for scheduling your work day.

## Introduction

This is a web-based daily planner that allows users to create and manage a schedule for their workday. The scheduler provides features like displaying the current date, time blocks for standard business hours (9 AM to 5 PM), and color-coding to indicate whether each time block is in the past, present, or future. Users can also enter events into time blocks and save them to local storage, ensuring that their schedule persists even after refreshing the page.
